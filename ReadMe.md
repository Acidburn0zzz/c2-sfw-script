Wiki's Bridge from Legacy to Federation
=======================================

This script is derived from the original cgi script that ran the c2.com wiki for 20 years.
It retains the read parts revised to format output in json instead of html.
Through this portal the content of the world's first wiki will emerge into a information store modeled on life itself.

See [c2.fed.wiki.org](http://c2.fed.wiki.org/) for sample script output.

The Federated Wiki serves many purposes beyond preserving the influential writing that launched the software pattern and agile development methods. This bridge makes the original wiki part of that agenda. Jon Udell says, "Wiki creator reinvents collaboration, again."
